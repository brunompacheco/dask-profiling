# dask-profiling

A fork of [pandas-profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling), aimed to generate profile reports from a **dask** `DataFrame`. This is a very rough work. It was developed with personal use in mind, so use at your own risk. Even though, discussions, issues and contributions are well appreciatted.
